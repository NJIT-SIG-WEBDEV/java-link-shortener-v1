# java-link-shortener-v1
Version 1 of the Java link shortener app

This is the first version of the link shortener app that we built on 3/3/16. This version just shortens the user supplied URL and stores both the URLs into the database. In the next class, we will make a web app (v2) out of this app so that the user is actually redirected to the actual website when he enters the short URL in browser.
